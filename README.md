# CanSat Code

This is where the code for the arduino on the CanSat itself goes. A user should be able to clone this repo, open MasterCan.ino and compile the porgram without any tinkering.

## Coding guidelines

Wherever possible try and split each feature into separate files and functions, that will then be called by MasterCan.ino. This allows us to keep stuff neat and stops us from ending up with a large unruly program.

**KEEP CODE READABLE**: We should all be able to understand what is going on without contacting you. That means **comment** your code, and **use logical variable names**.
